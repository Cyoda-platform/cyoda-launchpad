Engage in any activity that constitutes abuse of the Services or negatively impacts other users, as determined by Cyoda in its sole discretion.
Abuse: Cyoda reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services immediately and without notice if we suspect, in our sole discretion, that you are engaging in prohibited uses or otherwise abusing the Services.
6. User Content Data Management

This section, as amended, outlines how Cyoda handles User Content, with particular focus on the data We may use to improve and develop Our AI Assistant and, critically, the data We commit not to access or use for such purposes. Your trust is of paramount importance to Us, and We are dedicated to maintaining transparency in Our data practices. All other provisions, terms, and conditions of the 'User Content Data Management' section not expressly amended herein, along with all other sections of Our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, shall remain in full force and effect.

A. Data We Use for AI Assistant Improvement

To continuously develop, improve, and enhance the functionality, accuracy, safety, and overall performance of Our AI Assistant, Cyoda may use the categories of data specified below ("Improvement Data"). By accessing or using the AI Assistant, You grant Cyoda a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, create derivative works from, and otherwise exploit such Improvement Data solely for the purpose of AI Assistant Improvement as defined herein, and for no other purpose without Your explicit consent:

User Input Prompts:
We may use Your User Input Prompts to understand user needs, refine the AI Assistant's ability to generate relevant and accurate responses, identify patterns and areas for improvement, and to train, fine-tune, and evaluate the underlying machine learning models and algorithms that power the AI Assistant. For example, if You provide a prompt seeking a specific type of code or a solution to a particular problem, We may use that prompt (and the corresponding AI-Generated Code, as described below) to better understand context, intent, and to improve the quality and relevance of future outputs generated by the AI Assistant in similar scenarios.
AI-Generated Code:
We may use the AI-Generated Code produced by Our AI Assistant in direct response to Your User Input Prompts to further teach, train, evaluate, and improve the AI Assistant. This includes, but is not limited to, using such AI-Generated Code as training data for Our machine learning models to enhance their coding capabilities, logical reasoning, accuracy, efficiency, and safety. This process is integral to refining the quality, utility, and reliability of the code and other outputs the AI Assistant can produce. For clarity, this right pertains to the specific AI-Generated Code output by the AI Assistant and not to Your broader codebase or applications into which You may choose to incorporate such AI-Generated Code, unless such broader codebase is separately provided as a User Input Prompt or an Open Source Repository Contribution.
Open Source Repository Contributions:
If You voluntarily choose to contribute code, documentation, or other materials to the specific public open-source software repositories expressly designated by Cyoda for the AI Assistant's development, maintenance, or related components ("Open Source Repository Contributions"), We may use these contributions for AI Assistant Improvement. Your Open Source Repository Contributions are primarily governed by the terms of the applicable open-source licenses associated with those specific repositories. By making such contributions, You acknowledge and agree that, in addition to the rights granted under the applicable open-source license, Cyoda may also use these contributions for the purposes of AI Assistant Improvement as described in these Terms.
B. Data We Do Not Access or Use for AI Assistant Improvement

Notwithstanding any other provision in these Terms or any other agreement You may have with Cyoda, Cyoda explicitly and unequivocally commits to the following regarding Your data:

User Application Data in Your Running System: Cyoda will not, retrieve, copy, use Your User Application Data that is located, stored, and managed within Your Running System for the purposes of AI Assistant Improvement, or for training, fine-tuning, or evaluating any of Cyoda's AI models or algorithms. Our AI Assistant is designed and intended to operate without needing to access or process the entirety of Your applications, databases, or proprietary data repositories residing within Your Running System, unless You explicitly and intentionally extract specific portions of such data and provide them as User Input Prompts to the AI Assistant. The boundary of Your Running System is respected as Your private operational domain.
C. Data Processing by Third-Party LLMs and Open Source Option

You acknowledge and agree that when You use the AI Assistant, Your User Input Prompts may be transmitted to and processed by third-party Large Language Models (LLMs) that Cyoda utilizes to provide the AI Assistant's functionality.1 Cyoda does not control the data processing practices of these third-party LLM providers once Your User Input Prompts are transmitted to them. We encourage You to review the terms and privacy policies of any such third-party LLM providers if You have concerns about their data handling. Currently the LLMs being utilised include, but are not restricted to:  "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt-4.1-mini", "gpt-4o", "gpt-4.1-nano", "o4-mini"

The Cyoda AI Assistant is an open-source project. If You wish to have direct control over which LLMs Your User Input Prompts are sent to, or if You prefer to use Your own LLM instances, You have the option to download the AI Assistant's open-source code and configure it to use the LLM(s) of Your choice according to the project's documentation and licensing. In such a self-hosted or self-configured scenario, Your use of the AI Assistant and the processing of Your data by LLMs will be governed by Your own configurations and the terms of the LLMs You choose to integrate.

D. Data Retention and Loss (Alpha/Beta Period)

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT DURING THE ALPHA/BETA PERIOD, CYODA PROVIDES NO GUARANTEES REGARDING DATA RETENTION OR DURABILITY FOR ANY USER DATA, USER INPUT PROMPTS, OR AI-GENERATED CODE. Such data may be lost, corrupted, or become inaccessible due to bugs, updates, system failures, or intentional data wipes necessary during development. Cyoda reserves the right to delete such data at any time. While Cyoda may endeavour to provide at least three (3) UK working days' notice before planned data deletion events affecting active users, THIS NOTICE IS NOT GUARANTEED.

E. User Responsibility for Backups

YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING AND MAINTAINING BACKUPS OF YOUR USER DATA, USER INPUT PROMPTS, AND ANY AI-GENERATED CODE YOU WISH TO PRESERVE. Cyoda accepts no responsibility or liability for any loss, corruption, or deletion of such data.

F. Upholding Other Protections and User Responsibilities

These amendments are supplementary to, and form an integral part of, the overall 'User Content Data Management' section of these Terms of Service. All other terms, conditions, user rights, obligations, and responsibilities outlined in that section, and in Our broader Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, continue to apply in full. You remain solely responsible for the content, legality, and appropriateness of Your User Input Prompts and any Open Source Repository Contributions You make, ensuring they comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights or other rights of any third party.

7. Intellectual Property

Except for the limited license granted in Section 5, Cyoda and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, including all related intellectual property rights. These Terms do not grant you any rights to use Cyoda's trademarks, logos, domain names, or other brand features. Open Source Contributions are subject to the relevant open-source licenses. You retain ownership of Your User Input Prompts and User Application Data, subject to the licenses granted herein. Cyoda makes no claim of ownership over AI-Generated Code; however, your use of AI-Generated Code may be subject to third-party licenses (including open-source licenses) if the AI Assistant incorporates or references third-party materials in generating such code.2 You are responsible for ensuring your use of AI-Generated Code complies with any applicable licenses.
