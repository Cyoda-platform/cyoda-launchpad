# Asynchronous Workflow Automation: State Machines as First-Class Citizens

Modern distributed applications are no longer simple request/response
systems. They are **stateful, long-lived, and highly orchestrated**.
From customer onboarding journeys to complex financial transactions,
these workflows often span days, involve multiple approvals, and must
remain auditable and consistent end-to-end.

For developers, this presents a challenge: how do you ensure
**automation without sacrificing reliability and auditability**?
Traditional approaches often bolt on workflow engines or messaging
systems around a database. But this creates fragile integrations,
duplicated logic, and operational overhead.

Cyoda's **Entity Database Management System (EDBMS)** takes a different
approach by treating **state machines as first-class citizens** within
the data platform itself. This shift changes how developers design, build, 
and maintain complex systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why State Machines Belong Inside the Platform

At the heart of Cyoda's design is the concept of an **Entity**: a
business object (such as a customer, product,trade, or claim) that carries not
just data, but also a **state**. Each entity has a finite set of valid
states (e.g., `Pending`, `Approved`, `Settled`, `Cancelled`) and a **workflow** that
defines how it can transition between them, with rules that govern which transitions 
between with states are allowed under what conditions.

By embedding this directly into the database platform and the entities themselves:

-   **No external orchestration is required**: Developers don't need to
    glue together a database, a message broker, and a workflow engine.
    The system itself manages the lifecycle of each data entity.
-   **Guaranteed consistency**: Because Cyoda couples state transitions
    with extended ACID semantics and snapshot isolation, workflows can
    run asynchronously **without breaking transactional guarantees**.
-   **Audit built in**: Every state change is persisted as an immutable
    event, providing a natural **data lineage**. Instead of custom audit
    tables or external logging, the history is intrinsic to the data
    model.
-   **Simplified developer experience**: State transition logic is
    expressed in **Entity Processor classes**, directly associated with
    the data they govern. This eliminates scattered, duplicated workflow
    logic across services.

In other words, workflows are not an afterthought, they are the
**primary abstraction**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. **Customer Onboarding**

When onboarding a new customer, multiple steps must occur in sequence:
document collection, identity verification, risk assessment, approval,
and account creation.

-   **Traditional Approach**: Developers wire together external workflow
    tools with APIs and custom scripts, hoping everything stays in sync.
    Failures often leave the customer stuck mid-process, requiring
    manual intervention.
-   **Cyoda Approach**: Each customer is modeled as an **entity** with a
    state machine (`New → Verification → Approved → Active`).
    Transitions (e.g., from `Verification` to `Approved`) are tied to
    explicit **criteria** and **processors**. If a step fails, the
    system can retry asynchronously with **idempotent event handling**,
    or roll back gracefully while preserving a complete audit
    trail.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. **Claims Processing in Insurance**

Insurance claims often require input from adjusters, third-party
assessors, and compliance teams. These processes may take weeks and
involve dozens of state transitions.

-   **Traditional Approach**: Each stage of the claim is managed in
    separate systems, connected by batch jobs or message queues.
    Developers must implement reconciliation logic to handle
    discrepancies.
-   **Cyoda Approach**: The **claim itself is the unit of state**. The
    EDBMS enforces allowed transitions
    (`Filed → Under Review → Approved/Rejected → Paid`) and manages
    asynchronous workflows across distributed nodes. If an adjuster's
    review triggers downstream processes (e.g., payment generation), the
    platform automatically queues and executes them in order, ensuring
    **no step is skipped, duplicated, or lost**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. **KYC (Know Your Customer) Checks**

Financial institutions must run KYC checks when onboarding or reviewing
customers, often involving external APIs, manual reviews, and regulatory
reporting.

-   **Traditional Approach**: Developers must orchestrate calls to
    third-party APIs, manage retries, and store logs for
    regulators, often in separate, disconnected systems.
-   **Cyoda Approach**: KYC checks are modeled as **asynchronous state
    transitions**. External API calls are queued in **durable event
    streams**, with results feeding back into the entity's workflow. If
    an API fails, retries happen automatically, and the entire process
    is captured in the entity's **immutable audit log**. For developers,
    this means **less boilerplate, fewer integration points, and easier
    compliance**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Developer Advantage: Automation with Auditability

For developers, building on Cyoda's entity-centric model simplifies
system design in three key ways:

1.  **Reduced Glue Code**  No need to integrate multiple third-party
    workflow engines and message brokers.
2.  **Idempotent by Default**  Event-context sharding ensures that
    events for the same entity are processed serially, avoiding race
    conditions and complex conflict
    resolution.
3.  **Audit Without Extra Work**  Every state transition is recorded
    as an event, enabling **full traceability** for debugging,
    compliance, and analytics.

The result is faster delivery of features, greater confidence in
correctness, and a system that scales without becoming brittle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why This Matters for Developers

As systems grow more complex, **workflows become the system**. The
choice is clear: either build on top of tools that were never designed
for long-lived, stateful processes, or adopt a platform that **treats
workflows as core infrastructure**.

Cyoda's EDBMS is designed for developers who want:

-   **Automation without hidden complexity**
-   **Resilience built into the data layer**
-   **Auditability as a first-class concern**
-   **Confidence to build mission-critical applications without
    reinventing orchestration**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

Workflows are no longer side concerns, they are the backbone of modern
business systems. By making **state machines and workflows first-class
citizens**, Cyoda eliminates the need for brittle integrations and
provides developers with a platform that is **resilient, auditable, and
built for scale**.

For developers tasked with building the next generation of enterprise
applications, the future lies in platforms that unify **data,
transactions, and workflows** from day one. Cyoda is that platform.
