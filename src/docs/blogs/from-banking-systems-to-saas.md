# From Banking Systems to SaaS: Why Cyoda Exists

The modern enterprise landscape is defined by complexity, scale, and
constant change. For CTOs building mission-critical systems, the
question is not whether to adopt new technology, but **how to adopt
platforms that can survive under the pressure of real-world demands**.
Cyoda was born from exactly this challenge, out of lessons learned in
the mission-critical highly regulated world of **investment banking back-office systems**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Lessons from Investment Banking

In global banks, back-office platforms process billions of events daily:
trades, settlements, compliance checks, long-lived lifecycles and reconciliations. 
These systems must guarantee:

-   **High availability** trades worth billions cannot be lost due to
    node failure.
-   **Strict consistency** financial records must be accurate, duplicates are a no.
-   **Complete audit trails** every decision and state transition must
    be traceable.
-   **Support for long-lived workflows**, transactions may span days,
    weeks or years, with multiple approvals and regulatory checkpoints.

Traditional relational databases could provide ACID guarantees, but
scaling them linearly across global workloads proved brittle, and 
they are not good are highly structured data that represent financial 
products like FPML. Document
stores introduced flexibility but compromised on **transactional
integrity** and **auditable history**.

The result: teams stitched together a patchwork of RDBMS, messaging
systems, and workflow engines. While functional, these architectures
were **expensive, fragile, and difficult to evolve**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Gaps in Traditional Distributed Data Tech

Engineering leaders face recurring challenges when trying to scale
business-critical systems:

1.  **Fragmented architecture**  Databases, workflow engines, and
    event buses exist in silos, requiring glue code and custom
    integrations.
2.  **Operational overhead**  Each system has its own scaling,
    monitoring, and failure recovery model. Keeping them aligned is
    hard.
3.  **Inconsistent guarantees** Relational systems can't scale
    horizontally without trade-offs; NoSQL systems sacrifice ACID
    properties.
4.  **Compliance blind spots**  Reconstructing historical state
    requires custom logging and ETL pipelines.

These gaps slow down delivery and make systems fragile, especially under
regulatory scrutiny.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Cyoda Was Built Differently

Cyoda's founders set out to design a platform **from the ground up** for
the realities of financial systems, and beyond. The result is the
**Cyoda Platform**, powered by the **Cyoda Platform Library
(CPL)**.

What makes it different?

-   **Entity-Centric Model**: Business objects are modeled as **entities
    with state machines**, not just rows or documents. Workflows are
    built into the data itself.
-   **Extended ACID Semantics**: Transactions are asynchronous but
    guaranteed under **serializable snapshot isolation**, ensuring
    correctness even at scale.
-   **Event-Context Sharding**: A novel approach that preserves
    consistency while scaling out distributed processing, inspired by
    Kafka's partitioning model but optimized for transactional
    workflows.
-   **Inherent Auditability**: Every change is recorded as an immutable
    event. Complete data lineage is always available, with no bolt-on
    logging required.
-   **Cloud-Ready Architecture**: With the upcoming **Cyoda Cloud**,
    client logic integrates via **gRPC**, and entity models can be
    configured without deep rewrites, supporting a smooth transition to
    SaaS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## A Platform for Mission-Critical Systems

For CTOs, the stakes are high: downtime means lost revenue, inconsistent
data means regulatory risk, and complex integrations mean higher costs.
Cyoda's EDBMS was built to address these exact pain points, not as an
afterthought, but as a **design principle**.

By unifying **data storage, workflows, and transaction orchestration**
into one coherent platform, Cyoda delivers:

-   **Resilience** on par with finance-grade systems.
-   **Faster delivery** with less glue code.
-   **Built-in compliance and audit capabilities**.
-   **Scalability by design**, not as a bolt-on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

Cyoda exists because traditional databases and distributed systems
weren't built for the realities of modern, high-stakes business
processes. Inspired by decades of experience in banking and
data-intensive applications, Cyoda rethinks the foundations of how we
build **trustworthy, scalable, and auditable systems**.

For CTOs facing the challenge of building the next generation of
mission-critical platforms, Cyoda represents not just another tool, but
an entirely new paradigm.
