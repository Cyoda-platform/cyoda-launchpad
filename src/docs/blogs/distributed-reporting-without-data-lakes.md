# Distributed Reporting Without Data Lakes

For many enterprises, reporting and analytics have become a **two-step
dance**: first, data must be extracted from operational systems into a
data lake or warehouse, and only then can it be queried for insights.
This pattern works---but it comes at a cost: duplicated infrastructure,
long ETL pipelines, and delayed insights.

Cyoda takes a different approach. By embedding **distributed reporting
directly into the transactional platform**, Cyoda enables real-time,
scalable queries across clusters---without the overhead of separate data
lakes. For CTOs seeking **faster insights with less infrastructure**,
this shift represents a fundamental change.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Problem with Data Lakes and ETL

Most organizations rely on the following model:

1.  **Extract** -- Data is pulled from operational systems.\
2.  **Transform** -- It's reshaped, cleaned, and often denormalized.\
3.  **Load** -- It's stored in a data lake or warehouse for BI tools to
    consume.

While effective, this model introduces several pain points:

-   **Latency**: Reports are often hours or days behind operational
    reality.\
-   **Complexity**: ETL pipelines are fragile, requiring constant
    maintenance.\
-   **Duplication**: Data is stored and processed twice---once for
    operations, once for reporting.\
-   **Cost**: Maintaining two parallel infrastructures (operational DB +
    analytics warehouse) drives up both cloud and engineering spend.

For teams that require **real-time reporting with accuracy**, this model
is no longer sustainable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cyoda's Approach: Distributed Reporting Inside the Platform

Cyoda eliminates the need for external ETL pipelines by embedding
**distributed reporting** directly into the **Cyoda Platform Library
(CPL)**【8†files_uploaded_in_conversation】.

How it works:

-   **Report Configurations**: Developers define reports using the same
    query language as for transactional entities, including filters,
    sorting, and grouping.\
-   **Cluster Execution**: The platform detects scheduled or ad-hoc
    reports and distributes execution across multiple Cyoda Processing
    Manager (CPM) nodes.\
-   **Partitioned Queries**: Large queries are broken down and executed
    in parallel across the cluster, then aggregated for the final
    result.\
-   **Consistency Guarantees**: Because reporting queries run against
    the **consistency clock**, they reflect an auditable snapshot of the
    system at a specific time.

In short: reporting is no longer a bolt-on. It's **native to the
platform**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why This Matters

1.  **No ETL Pipelines** -- Reports run directly on transactional data,
    removing the need to copy, clean, and re-shape data in a separate
    pipeline.\
2.  **Real-Time Insights** -- Queries reflect the live state of the
    system as of a specific consistency time, enabling faster
    decisions.\
3.  **Lower Cost** -- Eliminating data duplication reduces both
    infrastructure and operational overhead.\
4.  **Auditability by Default** -- Reports can be tied to point-in-time
    queries, ensuring outputs are verifiable and compliant.

This means CTOs no longer need to choose between **operational
integrity** and **analytical agility**---they can have both.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Real-World Applications

### 1. **Financial Services**

Risk reports, compliance checks, and liquidity positions can be run
directly against the transactional system---ensuring regulators and risk
managers see the **exact same data** as operational teams.

### 2. **Insurance**

Claims and underwriting teams can generate reports that reflect
**current state and historical progression**, without maintaining
separate reporting databases.

### 3. **Customer Analytics**

Onboarding funnels, churn metrics, and KYC progress reports can be
generated in near real time---driving faster response to customer needs.

## Comparison with Traditional BI Stacks

  **Infrastructure Complexity**  High (ETL + lake + BI) Low (built-in)

                                                        consistency clock

  **Cost**                       High                   Lower
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why CTOs Should Care

For CTOs, the decision to reduce infrastructure layers isn't just about
saving money---it's about **increasing agility**. With distributed
reporting:

-   Teams gain **faster time-to-insight**, shortening feedback loops.\
-   Systems are **simpler to maintain**, reducing operational risk.\
-   Compliance teams gain **confidence in auditability**, since reports
    align with the transactional truth.

In highly regulated, data-intensive industries, this isn't a
luxury---it's a strategic necessity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

The era of duplicating data into lakes and warehouses for reporting is
giving way to **platform-native approaches**. By building distributed
reporting directly into the operational platform, Cyoda enables
enterprises to achieve **real-time insights, lower costs, and stronger
compliance**---all without the baggage of traditional BI stacks.

For CTOs seeking to simplify their architecture while delivering more to
the business, Cyoda's distributed reporting model is a powerful
alternative.
