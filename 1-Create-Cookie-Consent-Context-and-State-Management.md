# Actionable Step: Create Cookie Consent Context and State Management

**Objective:** Establish a React context and state management system to handle cookie consent preferences, storage, and global state across the application.

**Prerequisites:** None.

**Action Items:**
1. Create a TypeScript interface defining cookie consent categories (Essential, Analytics, Marketing, Personalization) and user preferences structure
2. Implement a React Context (`CookieConsentContext`) with provider component to manage consent state globally
3. Create custom hooks (`useCookieConsent`, `useCookiePreferences`) for components to interact with consent state
4. Build localStorage utility functions to persist and retrieve consent preferences with expiration handling
5. Implement consent state initialization logic that checks for existing preferences on app startup
6. Add consent state update methods that trigger callbacks when preferences change
7. Create TypeScript types for consent events and callback functions
8. Add validation logic to ensure consent data integrity and handle migration of old consent formats

**Acceptance Criteria:** 
- Cookie consent context provides global state management for all four cookie categories
- Consent preferences persist in localStorage and survive browser sessions
- Custom hooks allow components to easily read and update consent state
- State changes trigger appropriate callbacks for analytics loading/unloading
- TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety across the consent system
