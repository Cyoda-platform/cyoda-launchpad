# Cookie Preferences Modal Fix Test

## Issues Fixed
1. **Mobile**: Cookie preferences modal was covered by the main cookie consent banner
2. **Desktop**: Modal was only half-visible, positioned too far to the left

## Test Environment
- Development server: http://localhost:8081
- Test page: http://localhost:8081/cookie-consent-test

## Critical Z-Index and Positioning Fixes

### Z-Index Hierarchy (Fixed)
- Cookie consent banner: `z-[9999]`
- Dialog overlay: `z-[10000]` (above banner)
- Dialog content: `z-[10001]` (above overlay)
- Banner hidden when modal is open

### Positioning Fixes
- **Mobile**: Uses `inset-x-4` with proper centering
- **Desktop**: Uses `sm:left-[50%] sm:translate-x-[-50%]` for proper centering

## Testing Checklist

### 1. Z-Index Layering (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Open cookie preferences modal
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Cookie consent banner is hidden when modal is open
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Modal appears above all other content
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Modal overlay blocks interaction with background content
- [ ] Check that modal can be interacted with without banner interference

### 2. Desktop Positioning (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Test on desktop viewport (>= 768px width)
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Modal is properly centered horizontally
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Modal is not cut off on the left side
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Modal is fully visible within viewport
- [ ] Check that modal doesn't extend beyond screen edges

### 3. Mobile Positioning and Visibility
- [ ] Open cookie preferences modal on mobile device (< 768px width)
- [ ] Verify dialog is properly positioned and visible
- [ ] Check that dialog doesn't extend beyond viewport edges
- [ ] Ensure dialog is centered horizontally with proper margins
- [ ] Verify dialog height doesn't exceed 85% of viewport height
- [ ] Check that scrolling works if content is too tall

### 2. Touch Interaction
- [ ] Tap on "Preferences" button to open modal
- [ ] Verify all buttons are easily tappable (minimum 44px touch target)
- [ ] Test toggle switches for each cookie category
- [ ] Verify buttons respond to touch without delay
- [ ] Check that close button (X) works properly

### 3. Content Layout
- [ ] Verify text is readable at mobile sizes
- [ ] Check that cookie category sections don't overlap
- [ ] Ensure proper spacing between elements
- [ ] Verify buttons stack vertically on mobile
- [ ] Check that long text wraps properly

### 4. Button Layout
- [ ] Verify primary buttons (Accept All, Reject All, Save) are full-width on mobile
- [ ] Check that buttons are properly spaced
- [ ] Ensure "Delete consent record" button is visible but less prominent
- [ ] Verify button text is readable at mobile sizes

### 5. Responsive Breakpoints
- [ ] Test at 320px width (small mobile)
- [ ] Test at 375px width (iPhone SE)
- [ ] Test at 414px width (iPhone Plus)
- [ ] Test at 768px width (tablet portrait)
- [ ] Verify smooth transition between mobile and desktop layouts

### 6. Accessibility
- [ ] Test with screen reader on mobile
- [ ] Verify focus management works with touch
- [ ] Check that all interactive elements are accessible
- [ ] Ensure proper ARIA labels are present

### 7. Performance
- [ ] Check that modal opens quickly on mobile
- [ ] Verify animations are smooth
- [ ] Test on slower mobile devices if possible

## Test Instructions

1. Open browser developer tools
2. Set device emulation to mobile (e.g., iPhone 12)
3. Navigate to http://localhost:8081/cookie-consent-test
4. Click "Reset Consent" to clear any existing preferences
5. Click the "Preferences" button in bottom-left corner
6. Test all functionality listed above

## Expected Behavior

### Mobile (< 768px):
- Dialog should use `inset-x-4` (16px margins on sides)
- Buttons should be full-width and stack vertically
- Text should be smaller but still readable
- Touch targets should be at least 44px

### Desktop (>= 768px):
- Dialog should be centered with `max-w-lg`
- Buttons should be inline and right-aligned
- Standard text sizes
- Hover states should work

## Issues Fixed

1. **Dialog positioning**: Changed from fixed center positioning to mobile-first responsive positioning
2. **Content overflow**: Added `max-h-[85vh] overflow-y-auto` for tall content
3. **Button layout**: Made buttons full-width on mobile, inline on desktop
4. **Text sizing**: Added responsive text sizes
5. **Touch targets**: Ensured proper spacing and sizing for mobile interaction
6. **Viewport handling**: Used `inset-x-4` instead of fixed positioning on mobile

## Browser Testing

Test on actual mobile devices if possible:
- iOS Safari
- Android Chrome
- Mobile Firefox
- Samsung Internet

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open in browser with mobile emulation
# Navigate to: http://localhost:8081/cookie-consent-test
```
