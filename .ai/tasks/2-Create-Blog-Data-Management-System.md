# Actionable Step: Create Blog Data Management System

**Objective:** Build a centralized system to load, process, and manage blog post data from markdown files in the src/docs/blogs directory.

**Prerequisites:** Set Up Markdown Processing Infrastructure must be completed first.

**Action Items:**
1. Create a blog service/hook to load all markdown files from src/docs/blogs
2. Implement caching mechanism for processed blog data using React Query
3. Create functions to parse frontmatter and extract metadata (title, date, author, tags, image)
4. Build content extraction logic to get first 50 words excluding frontmatter
5. Implement slug generation from filename or frontmatter
6. Add error handling for malformed markdown files
7. Create data transformation utilities to convert raw markdown to blog post objects
8. Set up automatic refresh mechanism when blog files change during development

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Blog service can successfully load and parse all markdown files from the blogs directory
- Processed blog data includes title, excerpt, metadata, and content
- Caching is implemented to avoid re-processing unchanged files
- Error handling gracefully manages malformed or missing files
