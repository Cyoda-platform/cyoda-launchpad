3. Update the featured post section to dynamically select the most recent or featured blog
4. Modify the blog grid to display actual blog posts from markdown files
5. Ensure proper loading states while blog data is being fetched
6. Maintain the existing visual design and styling from the current implementation
7. Add fallback content for when no blog posts are available
8. Implement proper error boundaries for blog loading failures

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Blog listing page displays actual blog posts from markdown files
- Featured post section shows dynamic content
- Loading states are properly handled
- Visual design matches the existing blog page styling
- Error states are gracefully handled with appropriate fallback content
