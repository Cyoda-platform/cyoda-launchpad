# Actionable Step: Set Up Markdown Processing Infrastructure

**Objective:** Install and configure the necessary dependencies to parse markdown files with frontmatter support and extract content for the blog system.

**Prerequisites:** None.

**Action Items:**
1. Install markdown processing libraries (react-markdown, gray-matter, remark-gfm)
2. Install additional dependencies for frontmatter parsing and content extraction
3. Create utility functions for markdown file processing
4. Create TypeScript interfaces for blog post data structure
5. Set up file system utilities for reading markdown files from the blogs directory
6. Create helper functions to extract first 50 words from markdown content
7. Add image extraction utilities for markdown content and frontmatter

**Acceptance Criteria:** 
- All required markdown processing dependencies are installed
- Utility functions can successfully parse markdown files with frontmatter
- TypeScript interfaces are defined for blog post structure
- Helper functions can extract content previews and images from markdown files
