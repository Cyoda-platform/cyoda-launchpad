# Actionable Step: Integrate with Existing Design System

**Objective:** Ensure all new blog components use the existing project's design system, styling patterns, and UI components consistently.

**Prerequisites:** All previous steps must be completed first.

**Action Items:**

3. Ensure proper use of Tailwind CSS classes and custom CSS variables
4. Implement the existing glow effects and hover animations on interactive elements
5. Apply the correct color scheme and typography from the design system
6. Ensure responsive design works across all device sizes
7. Add proper dark/light theme support using the existing theme system
8. Implement consistent spacing and layout patterns
9. Apply the existing card styling and backdrop blur effects
10. Ensure accessibility standards are maintained across all components

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All blog components visually integrate seamlessly with the existing design
