# Actionable Step: Add Error Handling and Loading States

**Objective:** Implement robust error handling and loading states throughout the blog system to provide a smooth user experience.

**Prerequisites:** Integrate with Existing Design System must be completed first.

**Action Items:**
1. Add loading skeletons for the blog listing page while data is being fetched
2. Implement error boundaries to catch and handle React component errors
3. Create user-friendly error messages for various failure scenarios
4. Add retry mechanisms for failed blog data loading
5. Implement loading states for individual blog article pages
6. Add proper error handling for missing or corrupted markdown files
7. Create fallback content for when blog data is unavailable
8. Implement network error handling with appropriate user feedback
9. Add loading indicators for search functionality
10. Ensure error states maintain the existing design system styling
11. Add proper logging for debugging purposes in development mode

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Loading states are visually appealing and consistent with the design system
- Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- Users can retry failed operations where appropriate
- The application gracefully handles all error scenarios without crashing
- Loading and error states work properly across all blog functionality
- Error boundaries prevent component crashes from breaking the entire application
