# Actionable Step: Implement Cookie Consent Banner Component

**Objective:** Create a GDPR-compliant cookie consent banner that displays on first visit and provides clear Accept/Decline options with legal compliance messaging.

**Prerequisites:** Actionable Step 1 (Cookie Consent Context and State Management) must be completed first.

**Action Items:**
1. Design and implement a responsive cookie consent banner component using existing UI components (Card, Button from shadcn/ui)
2. Add banner positioning logic to display at bottom of screen without blocking critical content
3. Implement clear messaging that explains cookie usage according to EU GDPR requirements from the cookie policy
4. Create "Accept All" and "Decline All" buttons with appropriate styling and accessibility attributes
5. Add "Manage Preferences" button that opens detailed preference management modal
6. Implement banner visibility logic that shows only on first visit or when consent has expired
7. Add smooth animation transitions for banner appearance and dismissal
8. Integrate with cookie consent context to update global state when user makes choices
9. Ensure banner meets accessibility standards (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
10. Add proper z-index management to ensure banner appears above other content
11. Implement responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Banner displays only when consent is required (first visit or expired consent)
- Clear, legally compliant messaging explains cookie usage per GDPR requirements
- Accept/Decline buttons immediately update consent state and hide banner
- Banner is fully accessible and meets WCAG guidelines
- Responsive design works across all device sizes
- Banner integrates seamlessly with existing application styling
