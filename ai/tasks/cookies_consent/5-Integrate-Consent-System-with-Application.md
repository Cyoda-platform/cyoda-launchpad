# Actionable Step: Integrate Consent System with Application

**Objective:** Integrate the complete cookie consent system into the main application, ensuring proper initialization and component rendering across all pages.

**Prerequisites:** Actionable Steps 1-4 (Context, Banner, Analytics Service, and Preference Management) must be completed first.

**Action Items:**
1. Wrap the main App component with the CookieConsentProvider to provide global consent state
2. Add the cookie consent banner component to the main application layout
3. Integrate the persistent preferences button into the application's main layout
4. Connect the analytics service to the consent context with proper event listeners
5. Implement consent initialization logic in the main App component or main.tsx
6. Add proper component ordering to ensure consent system loads before any tracking scripts
7. Test consent system integration across all existing routes (Index, Products, Pricing, Blog, etc.)
8. Ensure consent banner appears correctly on all pages without layout conflicts
9. Verify that analytics loading/unloading works correctly when navigating between pages
10. Add error boundaries around consent components to prevent application crashes
11. Implement consent system performance optimization to minimize impact on page load times
12. Test consent persistence across browser sessions and page refreshes
13. Verify that no analytics scripts load before consent is granted on any page

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Cookie consent system is active and functional across all application routes
- Consent banner displays appropriately on first visit without breaking existing layouts
- Preferences button is visible and accessible from all pages
- Analytics integration responds correctly to consent changes throughout the application
- No tracking scripts or requests occur without explicit user consent
- Consent preferences persist correctly across browser sessions and page navigation
- Application performance is not negatively impacted by consent system integration
