# Actionable Step: Develop Cookie Preference Management System

**Objective:** Build a detailed preference management modal that allows users to control individual cookie categories and provides the "Preferences" button mentioned in the cookie policy.

**Prerequisites:** Actionable Steps 1 (Cookie Consent Context) and 2 (Cookie Consent Banner) must be completed first.

**Action Items:**
1. Create a cookie preferences modal component using Dialog/Modal from shadcn/ui components
2. Design preference sections for each cookie category: Essential, Analytics, Marketing, and Personalization
3. Implement toggle switches for each non-essential cookie category (Essential remains always on)
4. Add detailed descriptions for each cookie category explaining their purpose and data usage
5. Create "Save Preferences" and "Accept All" buttons within the modal
6. Implement the persistent "Preferences" button that appears in the left corner of the screen as specified in cookie policy
7. Add modal opening logic triggered by the preferences button and "Manage Preferences" link from banner
8. Integrate preference changes with the cookie consent context to update global state
9. Implement preference validation to ensure essential cookies cannot be disabled
10. Add confirmation messaging when preferences are saved successfully
11. Create responsive modal design that works on all device sizes
12. Ensure modal meets accessibility standards with proper focus management and keyboard navigation
13. Add animation transitions for smooth modal opening and closing

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Modal displays all four cookie categories with appropriate descriptions from cookie policy
- Essential cookies are clearly marked as "Always On" and cannot be disabled
- Toggle switches accurately reflect current consent state and update context when changed
- Persistent "Preferences" button is visible in left corner as specified in policy
- Modal is fully accessible and follows WCAG guidelines
- Preference changes immediately take effect and are persisted to localStorage
- Modal integrates seamlessly with existing application design system
