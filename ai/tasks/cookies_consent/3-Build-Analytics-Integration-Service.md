# Actionable Step: Build Analytics Integration Service

**Objective:** Create a service that dynamically loads Google Analytics only when user consents, and provides an enableAnalytics() function for conditional script loading.

**Prerequisites:** Actionable Step 1 (Cookie Consent Context and State Management) must be completed first.

**Action Items:**
1. Create an analytics service module with functions to dynamically load/unload Google Analytics scripts
2. Implement `enableAnalytics()` function that injects Google Analytics script tags into the document head
3. Create `disableAnalytics()` function that removes analytics scripts and clears tracking data
4. Add Google Analytics configuration with proper tracking ID and privacy-compliant settings
5. Implement analytics initialization that respects user consent state from context
6. Create utility functions to check if analytics is currently loaded and active
7. Add event tracking wrapper functions that only execute when analytics consent is granted
8. Implement analytics script loading with error handling and fallback mechanisms
9. Create cleanup functions to remove analytics cookies and localStorage data when consent is withdrawn
10. Add TypeScript interfaces for analytics configuration and tracking events
11. Implement consent change listeners that automatically enable/disable analytics based on user preferences
12. Ensure analytics loading doesn't block page rendering or affect performance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Google Analytics loads only after explicit user consent for analytics cookies
- Analytics scripts are completely absent from the page when consent is declined
- enableAnalytics() function successfully initializes tracking without errors
- Analytics data and cookies are properly cleaned up when consent is withdrawn
- Service integrates with consent context to automatically respond to preference changes
- No analytics requests are made to Google servers without user consent
