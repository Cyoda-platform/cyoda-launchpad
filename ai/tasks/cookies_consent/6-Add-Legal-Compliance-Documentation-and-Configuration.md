# Actionable Step: Add Legal Compliance Documentation and Configuration

**Objective:** Ensure the cookie consent implementation meets all legal requirements from GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, and aligns with the existing cookie policy documentation.

**Prerequisites:** Actionable Step 5 (Application Integration) must be completed first.

**Action Items:**
1. Review and validate that all cookie consent messaging matches the language in docs/cookies_policy-eu.txt
2. Ensure cookie categories and descriptions align exactly with those specified in the cookie policy
3. Add proper legal disclaimers and links to full cookie policy within the consent components
4. Implement consent expiration logic that complies with legal requirements (typically 12 months)
5. Add audit logging for consent decisions to support GDPR compliance reporting if needed
6. Create configuration file for easy updates to cookie policy links and legal text
7. Verify that "legitimate interest" vs "consent" legal bases are properly implemented for each cookie category
8. Add proper data retention policies for consent records as required by GDPR
9. Implement consent withdrawal mechanisms that fully comply with GDPR Article 7(3)
10. Add documentation for developers on maintaining legal compliance when adding new tracking
11. Create testing checklist to verify ongoing compliance with EU regulations
12. Ensure consent system supports required GDPR rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability)
13. Add configuration for different regional compliance requirements if needed in the future
