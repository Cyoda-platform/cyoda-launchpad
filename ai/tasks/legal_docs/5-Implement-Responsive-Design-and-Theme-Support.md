# Actionable Step: Implement Responsive Design and Theme Support

**Objective:** Ensure all legal document pages support both dark and light themes and are fully responsive across all device sizes with proper typography and spacing.

**Prerequisites:** Actionable Step 1 (Create Legal Document Page Components) must be finished first.

**Action Items:**
1. Apply Tailwind CSS classes for responsive typography that scales appropriately across screen sizes
2. Implement proper spacing and padding that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
3. Ensure all text content is readable in both light and dark themes using appropriate Tailwind color classes
4. Add responsive container classes to prevent content from becoming too wide on large screens
5. Implement proper line height and text spacing for optimal readability of legal document content
6. Test legal document pages in both light and dark theme modes
7. Verify that headings, paragraphs, and lists are properly styled and maintain hierarchy in both themes
8. Ensure proper contrast ratios are maintained for accessibility compliance
9. Test responsive behavior on mobile devices (320px+), tablets (768px+), and desktop (1024px+)
10. Add proper print styles using Tailwind's print utilities for users who want to print legal documents

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All legal document pages display correctly in both light and dark themes
- Content is fully responsive and readable on all screen sizes from mobile to desktop
- Typography hierarchy is clear and consistent across all legal document pages
- Text contrast meets accessibility standards in both theme modes
