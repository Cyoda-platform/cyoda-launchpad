# Actionable Step: Test Legal Document Pages Integration

**Objective:** Perform thorough testing of all legal document pages to ensure they integrate properly with the existing application, work across all routes, and maintain functionality in different scenarios.

**Prerequisites:** All previous Actionable Steps (1-5) must be finished first.

**Action Items:**
1. Test direct navigation to each legal document URL (`/cookie-policy`, `/privacy-policy`, `/terms-of-service`)
2. Verify that all legal document pages load correctly when accessed via browser refresh
3. Test navigation from footer links to each legal document page and back to main site
4. Test navigation from cookie consent banner links to legal document pages
5. Verify that legal document pages work correctly with the application's base URL configuration for production
6. Test legal document pages in both light and dark theme modes
7. Perform responsive testing on multiple screen sizes and devices
8. Test browser back/forward navigation from legal document pages
9. Verify that legal document pages don't interfere with existing application functionality
10. Test that legal document pages work correctly when the cookie consent banner is visible
11. Verify proper error handling if legal document pages fail to load
12. Test accessibility features including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
13. Perform cross-browser testing on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
14. Test legal document page performance and loading times

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All legal document pages are accessible via direct URL navigation
- Footer and cookie consent banner links work correctly
- Pages function properly in both theme modes and all screen sizes
- No JavaScript errors occur during navigation or page loading
- Browser navigation (back/forward) works correctly
- Legal document pages don't break existing application functionality
- Pages meet accessibility standards and work with assistive technologies
