# Actionable Step: Update Footer Component Links

**Objective:** Replace placeholder links in the Footer component with functional navigation links to the legal document pages and add the missing Cookie Policy link.

**Prerequisites:** Actionable Step 2 (Set Up Routing for Legal Document Pages) must be finished first.

**Action Items:**
1. Open `src/components/Footer.tsx` and locate the bottom bar section with legal links
2. Replace the Privacy Policy placeholder link (`href="#"`) with proper React Router Link to `/privacy-policy`
3. Replace the Terms of Service placeholder link (`href="#"`) with proper React Router Link to `/terms-of-service`
4. Add a new Cookie Policy link using React Router Link to `/cookie-policy`
5. Import the Link component from 'react-router-dom' at the top of the file
6. Ensure all three legal links are properly styled and maintain consistent spacing
7. Verify that the links maintain the existing hover effects and transition animations
8. Test that clicking each link navigates to the correct legal document page
9. Ensure the footer layout remains responsive and doesn't break on mobile devices
10. Confirm that the link styling matches the existing design system patterns

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Footer contains three functional legal document links: Cookie Policy, Privacy Policy, and Terms of Service
- All links use React Router Link components for proper SPA navigation
- Links navigate to the correct legal document pages when clicked
- Footer maintains its existing responsive design and styling
- Hover effects and transitions work properly on all legal links
- No layout issues occur on different screen sizes
